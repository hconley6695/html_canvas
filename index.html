	var c = document.querySelector('#c');
	var ctx = c.getContext("2d");

	// We can use what we already know about rectangles to "erase" portions of a canvas using fillRect and setting the fillStyle to our background color.
	ctx.fillStyle = "blue";

	// NUMBERS: STARTING X COORDINATE, STARTING Y COORDINATE, WIDTH, HEIGHT
	//FILLRECT IS A SOLID FILLED IN RECTANGLE
	ctx.fillRect(100, 100, 100, 100);
	// STROKERECT IS NOT FILLED IN RECTANGLE
	ctx.strokeRect(50, 50, 50, 80);
	// clearRect is an easier way to do the same thing without modifying the fillStyle
	ctx.clearRect(125, 125, 25, 25);


	// If you want to erase the entire canvas, you could call clearRect with the dimensions of canvas as follows:
	// ctx.clearRect(0, 0, c.width, c.height);

	// tells canvas that it's about to draw something
	ctx.beginPath();
	// moves your "pen" to the point on the screen of the x, y coordinates; doesn't make any sort of line on the canvas
	ctx.moveTo(10, 10);
	// moves your "pen" to the point on the screen of the x, y coordinates; makes a line on page
	ctx.lineTo(50, 50);
	ctx.lineTo(50, 10);
	ctx.lineTo(10, 10);
	//  must call one of the functions below for shape to show
	ctx.fill();
	// ctx.stroke();

	// Canvas2D allows you to translate (move), rotate, or scale objects.

	// Scaling
	// scale(x,y) multiplies the x and y values by a given factor so

	// ctx.scale(2,3);
	ctx.beginPath();
	ctx.moveTo(200, 200);
	ctx.lineTo(250, 250);
	ctx.lineTo(250, 200);
	ctx.lineTo(200, 200);
	ctx.stroke();
	// will make all values twice as large on the x axis and three times as large on the y axis.

	// Translation
	// translate(x,y) moves all subsequent draw commands by x number of pixels on horizontally and y pixels vertically.
	// moves all elements drawn after it 20 pixels to the rights and 40 pixels down.
	ctx.translate(20,40); 

	// Rotation
	// ctx.rotate(angleRadians) rotates an object a certain number of radians (generally) about its center. You may have learned about radians in school but here's a handy formula to convert a value from degrees to radians.
	// radians = degrees * (Math.PI/180)

	ctx.rotate(10);

	// Don't ask us why everything in Computer Graphics uses radians. We have no idea. :)

	// Order of operations
	// You should generally scale objects first, rotate them next, and then finally translate last. There are times when you'd want to rotate around an arbitrary point instead of an object's center, that's out of scope for this lesson.

	// Itâ€™s important to note that whatever transformations apply for all subsequent objects until you reverse them.
